# Reflexive note

## Reflections on my learning process

The main challenge I had to face all troughout my encoding was my encoding material in itself. I chose to encode census records, which are both quite easy and quite hard to encode. 

They are quite easy as they already have pre-made categories of informations, which I simply have to translate into TEI. For example, the "name" in the records becomes a <name/> attribute.

They are quite hard to encode as they are mixed-documents, both preprinted and handwritten. A someone discovering XML and TEI, I chose not to make any difference between preprinted writting and handwritten writing, except for handwritten abbreviations.

I may have oversimplified certain preprinted categories in the records. While it made it easier for me to encode those census records, such an oversimplification may lead to an accumulation of small errors.

## What I could do to improve my encoding

I did not correct any mistake from my previous encodings. For example, back in assignment 2, I chose not to properly encode the age, gender, and role of each recorded individual, but only indicating it in attributes. If I were to remake that encoding, I would use proper elements regarding age, gender, and role. However, I chose not to redo any of my encodings when generating this assignment's ODD.

## What I was unable to do

Census records are printed as tables. I wasn't able to reproduce that aspect, so I chose to ignore that particular physical aspect.

My encoding differentiates between maiden name and marital name. I forgot to make that differentiation visible in my assignment 2 encoding, and as I chose not to correct that previous asssignment,thise difference is not visible in the HTML files created for those encodings.

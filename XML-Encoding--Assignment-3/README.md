# XML-Encoding Assignment-3


This repository contains the documents requested for the final assignment of the TEI-XML course from the M2 TNAH at École des Chartes.

It contains TEI XML encodings for three census records extracts. These extracts were taken from three different records, each about a different "quartier" of the French city of Tours, in 1872.

In addition to the XML encodings, this repository contains an ODD customisation file generated from one of these encodings. RNG and HTML files, also present, were generated from this ODD.

A reflective note summarising my learning process throughout the project can also be found in this repository.


No generative AI was used in this assignment.

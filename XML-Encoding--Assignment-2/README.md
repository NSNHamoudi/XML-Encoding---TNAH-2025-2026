# XML-Encoding---Assignment 2

I selected three new samples for that second assignment ; the former samples were all from the same census record, so I chose to select three new samples from three different records.
Those three new samples are each from a different register representing a different neighbourhood of Tours in 1872.


# DTD vs. TEI
When I designed my DTD for the previous assignment, I had not think about the layout of my encoding. I had only encoded the census' raw informations. Through the TEI guidelines, I first tried to follow the original layout of the census records, by representing its ligns and columns in the metadata and encoding. However, I quickly realised I could not represent the census samples the way they were pre-printed, as tables to be completed by hand. 
I felt the meaning of the records' informations were getting lost through an improper layout representation in my encoding attempts. Thus, I chose to focus on the handwritten census informations and not represent the layout of the census tables. I took inspiration from my inital DTD and represented the different pre-printed column categories through types and attributes, instead of representing the ligns and columns as such. As I am aware I could have tried to represent the actual layout of the census records' table in my encoding, I may try to do so in my next assignment.
In my DTD, I had not think about the metadata either. Through TEI, I tried to encode as much as I could and as much as I knew. However, the presence of both printed and handwritten elements in my samples slightly complicated my encoding

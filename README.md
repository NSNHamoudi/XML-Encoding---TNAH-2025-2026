# XML-Encoding---TNAH-2025-2026 -- Census records

The selected documents are extracts of the digitisation of the 1872 census records for the city of Tours, France. These records were presented as tables, pre-printed on paper, and filled in by hand by the surveyed city’s municipal officials. The census recorded informations on every living inhabitant of the recorded city.

The 1872 tables contained informations about the place of residence and household composition (number of members, name, surname, age, occupation, role in the household, place of birth, nationality) as well as various observations. During the second half of the nineteenth century, censuses were conducted throughout France every five years.

I worked on census records during my year of Master 1, and I wanted to keep on working on that type of source material, as I find it particularly interesting to get a general idea of the social state of a given place at a given time. Last year, I worked on records from France’s July Monarchy and Second Republic, and I now want to observe the Third Republic era. I chose the 1872 census as it is the first census of that era. I chose Tours as it is my hometown.

The Tours records have been digitised by the Indre-et-Loire departmental archives and are now primarily used by genealogists. XML encoding would facilitate genealogical researches. The informations in the records being handwritten, it can be difficult to read or understand. Similarly, information can only be found by manually leafing through the pages of each census register, which is time-consuming at best, and can lead to nowhere at worse. XML encoding would automate this process, saving genealogists time and effort.
